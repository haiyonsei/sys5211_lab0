# Setup the environment
You can play with Scala/Chisel on the cloud right away using Binder. Binder is a free service that provides a temporary, interactive environment.

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/haiyonsei/sys5211_lab0/HEAD

# Local Installation (Windows)
Binder will discard any work after about 10 minutes of idle time. So if you don't want this, you can install the environment locally on your Windows machine by following the steps below.

## Step 1: Install Prerequisites
These are the basic tools required before setting up the bootcamp.

### 1.1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8
Download and install JDK 8 from the Adoptium (Eclipse Temurin) site.

https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases

### 1.2. Python 3
Python is required to run JupyterLab.
Download and install the latest version of Python from python.org.
During installation, make sure to check the box for "Add Python to PATH".

### 1.3. Git
Git is needed to download (clone) the source code.
The recommended way to install Git is by running the following command in Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
```

## Step 2: Install Jupyter and the Scala Kernel
With the prerequisites installed, you can now set up the Jupyter environment.

### 2.1. Install JupyterLab
Open a new Command Prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

### 2.2. Install the Scala Kernel (Almond)
This installs the "translator" that allows Jupyter to run Scala code, using a tool called Coursier (cs.exe).
Download and Unzip Coursier:

```
curl -fLo cs-x86_64-pc-win32.zip https://github.com/coursier/launchers/raw/master/cs-x86_64-pc-win32.zip
tar -xf cs-x86_64-pc-win32.zip
```

Set up Coursier: This command registers Coursier on your system.

```
move cs-x86_64-pc-win32.exe cs.exe
.\cs setup
```

Restart your terminal. It is crucial to close and reopen your Command Prompt window for the changes to take effect.

Install the Almond Kernel: In the new terminal window, run this command to install the Scala kernel for Jupyter.
```
.\cs launch almond -- --install
```

A success message like Installed scala kernel under ... should appear.

## Step 3: Set Up the Lab environment
### 3.1. Clone the git Repository
Navigate to the directory where you want to store the lab files and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/haiyonsei/sys5211_lab0.
```

### 3.2. Install the Custom Script
Move into the newly created lab directory and copy the necessary configuration file.

Move into the bootcamp directory

```
cd sys5211_lab0
```

Create the custom folder for Jupyter (it's okay if it already exists)

```
mkdir %YOUR_DIRECTORY%\.jupyter\custom
```

Copy the custom script

```
copy source\custom.js %YOUR_DIRECTORY%\.jupyter\custom\custom.js
```

## Step 4: Run the Jupyter notebook ðŸš€
You are all set!

Make sure you are in the sys5211_lab0 directory in your Command Prompt.

Run the following command to start the server:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will output several URLs in your terminal. Copy one of the http://localhost:8888/... URLs and paste it into your web browser to start the Chisel Assignment.
