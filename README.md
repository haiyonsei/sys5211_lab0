# Setup the environment

You can play with scala/chisel on the cloud right away with the binder:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/haiyonsei/sys5211_lab0/HEAD

## Local Installation (Window)
Binder will discard any work after 10 minutes of idle time. So if you don't want this, you can install jupyter notebook locally.
